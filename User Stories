user stories
create an application for end user to easily mass deploy their own applications using dockerhub images on different client(machines)
EPIC 1
all-in-one server which will be the single point of contact between the user and their machines on the server
	-http landing page
		-login
	-http page to handle user info
		-ip addresses/usernames/passwords
			-option to select waht port device should be runnin on if applicable
		-payload destination/dockerhub repo
			-data stored in a database for user convinience
	-submit/startjob
Payload delivery system
	-installation of docker on a device from the users input
	-installation of docker imagecreating and running the container
	-exposing a port on a specific device to be able to view docker webserver

EPIC2
PAYLOAD idea 1
have our own tool to be able to be deployable to many different devices Idea mockups
create instances of linux machines on our server and give users remote shh access to those devices
	-could be done through dockerizing and running a container then opening up a port on the device
	-educational purposes
	-throw up a simple alpine image

PAYLOAD IDEA 2
user wants to host 3 different servers with the same exact server for their demands
to handle high traffic coming into their server pages
a middle man server will be thrown up to load balance the incomming traffic and handle different conncetions
-try and simulate three different servers with a docker container runningX3 and then the 
middleman server will be in the middle handling traffic and handing them off to actual other ports 
or servers on the network so that the number of users is equally distributed among the different servers.
NGINX is a tool whic was made to serve that purpouse.
