user stories
create an application for end user to easily mass deploy their own bash shells an invoke functions and usage straight from the 
webpage
EPIC 1
all-in-one server which will be the single point of contact between the user and their machines on the server
	-http landing page
		-login/signup
	-http page to handle user info
		-how many alpine images will be running(on server2)
			-option to select what port device should be runnin on if applicable
		-response back from server with the http links:port# to take them to their online bash scripts
Payload delivery system -done by pod.com(server1)
	-installation of docker on a device from the users input
	-installation of docker imagecreating and running the container
	-exposing a port on a specific device to be able to view docker webserver
Payload consists of web bash server fo people to be able to remotely be able to run their commands in terminal

EPIC2
PAYLOAD idea 1
have our own tool to be able to be deployable to many different devices Idea mockups
create instances of linux machines on our server and give users remote shh access to those devices
	-could be done through dockerizing and running a container then opening up a port on the device
	-educational purposes
	-throw up a simple alpine image

PAYLOAD IDEA 2
user wants to host 3 different servers with the same exact server for their demands
to handle high traffic coming into their server pages
a middle man server will be thrown up to load balance the incomming traffic and handle different conncetions
-try and simulate three different servers with a docker container runningX3 and then the 
middleman server will be in the middle handling traffic and handing them off to actual other ports 
or servers on the network so that the number of users is equally distributed among the different servers.
NGINX is a tool whic was made to serve that purpouse.
